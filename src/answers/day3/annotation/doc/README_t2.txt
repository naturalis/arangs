WELCOME TO OUR SCRIPTS!

Use only the shell script "ketchup.sh", the python script is used by the .sh itself.

Use as follows:

bash ketchup.sh <path/to/query> <path/to/db>

It is likely that the files are here:

query: /gsd/To_Participant/ARANGS13/arangs/data/fasta

database: /gsd/To_Participant/ARANGS13/ITAG2_3_genomic.fasta.gz

DO NOTE that the database indicated is compressed and needs to be unzipped before use!
