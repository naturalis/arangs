<b>Rutger Vos</b> studied biology at the University of Amsterdam, where he graduated in
2000. He then embarked on his PhD research under professor Arne Mooers at Simon
Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, where he defended his thesis on
phyloinformatic problems in 2006. As a self-taught programmer he then became
involved in several open-source scientific software development projects while
continuing his research career through a postdoctoral fellowship at the
University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) and a Marie Curie research
fellowship at the University of Reading (Reading, UK). In Spring of 2012 he
commenced his employment as the bioinformaticist of the Naturalis Biodiversity
Center in a role where he combines novel research with
bioinformatics contributions to various research programmes within the
organization. In his spare time he also contributes to various open source
software projects (<a href="http://treebase.org/">TreeBASE</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-Phylo">Bio::Phylo</a>, <a href="http://nexml.org/">NeXML</a>) and is co-PI of the
PhyloTastic project. In addition Rutger has taught bioinformatics workshops in
the US, Japan, China, Kenya and once before at GTPB
(<a href="http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/PHYLOINF09/">PHYLOINF09</a>).

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for DNA have resulted in a yet a
bigger deluge of data. Researchers are learning that analysing such data sets is
becoming the bottleneck in their work. In many cases, several steps in these
analyses are fairly generic (e.g. quality control filtering, alignment to
reference sequences, typing) so that off-the-shelf pipelines can be applied. In
other cases, novel research approaches require development of new analysis
pipelines. Either way, all analysis steps should be repeatable and any changes
made to the data (e.g. renaming, annotation, alignment) should be recorded so
that the provenance of the results is clear and inferences are reproducible. In
this brief workshop we will establish several <b>best practices</b> of
reproducibility and provenance recording in the (comparative) analysis of data
obtained by NGS. In doing so we will encounter the commonly used
<b>technologies</b> that enable these best practices by working through <b>use
cases</b> that illustrate the underlying principles. Workflows will be manipulated
using graphical platforms (e.g. <b>Galaxy</b>, <b>Taverna</b>, etc.).
<h3>Best practices</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Standardized project organization</li>
	<li>Projects fully 'runnable' without user intervention</li>
	<li>No loss of data, metadata or source code through versioning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Next generation sequencing platforms</li>
	<li>File formats</li>
	<li>Command-line executables, command line scripting and batching</li>
	<li>High-level programming with domain-specific toolkits</li>
	<li>Revision control systems</li>
	<li>Workflow environments (both visual and command line)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use cases</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Phylogenetic placement of metagenomic data</li>
	<li>Typing of pathogens</li>
	<li>Comparative analysis of multicellular genomic data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Target audience</h2>
This course is aimed at researchers who've recently embarked on NGS projects and
now, faced with large amounts of data, would like to learn how to automate
generic analysis steps and develop new ones in a reproducible (and shareable)
way. The course will be illustrated with examples from specific single-celled
and multicellular taxa but the concepts are applicable to any species not
explicitly referred to in the course. The ideal attendee is a scientist who is
not afraid to get his/her hands dirty to acquire the computer-literacy skills
for dealing with the informatics side of data analysis.
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
The course assumes that attendees have some experience writing Bash scripts,
and/or some scripts from a programming languate (e.g. R, Perl, Python,
Ruby). Attendees should understand some of the science behind DNA sequencing
and sequence analysis, as we will not go deeply into underlying theory (or the
mechanics of given algorithms, for example) as such. What will be taught are
technical solutions for automating and scaling up such analyses, which will
include (but is not limited to) beginner-level programming. General computer literacy, 
(e.g. editing plain text data files, navigating the command line) will be assumed.
